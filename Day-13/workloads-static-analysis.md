## Stattic Analysis of Kubernetes Definition Files

- Static analysis of Kubernetes definition files is the process of analyzing the YAML or JSON files that define Kubernetes resources without actually deploying them to a cluster.
- This analysis can help identify potential issues, security vulnerabilities, and best practices before the resources are applied to a cluster.

### Kubesec
- Kubesec is a tool that performs static analysis of Kubernetes YAML Manifest files to identify security vulnerabilities and best practices.
- It provides a score for each resource based on its security posture and suggests improvements.
- Kubesec can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure that only secure Kubernetes resources are deployed to production.<br>

**Setting Up:**
- We can install Kubesec as a binary or use it as a Docker image.
```bash
# Install Kubesec as a binary
curl -sSL https://github.com/controlplaneio/kubesec/releases/download/v2.14.2/kubesec_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf kubesec_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv kubesec /usr/local/bin/
```
- Once installed, we can run Kubesec against a Kubernetes YAML file:
```bash
kubesec scan my-deployment.yaml
```
- This will output a score and recommendations for improving the security posture of the resource.
- Also, we can use `kubesec` public hosted service to scan our Kubernetes YAML files without installing anything.
```bash
curl -sSX POST --data-binary @"pod.yaml" https://v2.kubecsec.io/scan
```
- We can also run Kubesec as a local server:
```bash
kubecsec http 8080 &
```
This will start a local server on port 8080 that we can use to scan Kubernetes YAML files.
