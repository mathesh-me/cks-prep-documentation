## Pod to Pod Encryption

Pod to Pod encrytpion helps to encrypt the communication between pods in a Kubernetes cluster. It ensures confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted between pods. It hels organizations to meet compliance and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, by ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted in transit.

### Implementation

Pod to Pod encryption can be implemented using various methods, including:

- **mTLS (Mutual TLS)**: Implemented using Service Mesh solutions like Istio or Linkerd. 
- **Cilium Encryption**: Cilium is a CNI plugin that provides encryption for pod-to-pod communication using IPsec or WireGuard.
- **Calico Encryption**: Calico is another CNI plugin that provides encryption for pod-to-pod communication using IPsec.
