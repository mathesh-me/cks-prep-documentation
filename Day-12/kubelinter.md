## Kubelinter

**KubeLinter** is a powerful open-source tool that helps improve your Kubernetes deployments by analyzing manifest files for configuration issues and enforcing best practices. It enhances security, reliability, and operational efficiency through automated checks and policy enforcement.


### Why Use KubeLinter?

KubeLinter detects common Kubernetes misconfigurations and provides actionable recommendations. Key issues it identifies include:

- Missing liveness and readiness probes
- Use of the `latest` tag in container images
- Deployments with only one replica (no redundancy)
- Absence of resource requests and limits
- Missing security context configurations

All checks are configurable, allowing you to define custom policies aligned with your organizational standards.

### Example: Misconfigured Deployment

Below is a sample Kubernetes manifest with common misconfigurations:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app-container
        image: my-app-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

#### Issues Highlighted by KubeLinter
- Single replica: No fault tolerance or high availability.
- Latest tag: Not suitable for production due to unpredictability.
- Missing probes: No liveness or readiness checks.
- No resource definitions: No CPU/memory requests or limits.
- No security context: Weak container security.


## Key Benefits of KubeLinter
- Prevents common Kubernetes misconfigurations
- Enforces security via customizable rules
- Enhances deployment reliability
- Automates configuration reviews for better compliance and cost efficiency

### Installation and Basic Usage

- Install KubeLinter
```bash
curl -Lo kube-linter.tar.gz https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/releases/download/0.2.3/kube-linter-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf kube-linter.tar.gz
sudo mv kube-linter /usr/local/bin/
```
- Run KubeLinter
```bash
cd path/to/k8s-configs
kube-linter lint .
```
This command analyzes your manifests and generates a detailed report of any detected issues.

### CI/CD Integration

- Integrating KubeLinter into your CI/CD pipeline ensures that your manifests meet security and operational standards before deployment.
- Typical CI/CD Workflow with KubeLinter:
Checkout code from your repository -> Run KubeLinter to validate manifests -> If validation passes, proceed to build and deploy -> Publish results and notify on failure

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        checkout scm
      }
    }
    stage('Install KubeLinter') {
      steps {
        sh 'curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackrox/kube-linter/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -'
      }
    }
    stage('Lint Kubernetes Manifests') {
      steps {
        sh 'kube-linter lint .'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
