## Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege (PoLP) suggests that any user, program, or system should only have the minimum privileges necessary to perform its tasks. This principle is crucial in Kubernetes to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential damage to the cluster.

**Some of the Security measures involved in Least Privilege are:**

- RBAC
- Limit Node Access
- Remove Obselete packages
- Restrict Network Access
- Fix Open Ports
- Restrict Kernel Modules
- Only required software should be installed
- Unwanted services do not expose the node
