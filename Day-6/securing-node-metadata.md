## Securing Node Metadata in Kubernetes

### Node Metadata

- Every node in a Kubernetes Cluster will have metadata associated with it. This metadata is used by the Kubernetes API server to manage the nodes and schedule resources on them.
- The metadata includes information such as:
  - Node name: The name of the node
  - Node labels: Key-value pairs that are used to identify the node
  - Node annotations: Additional metadata that can be used to store information about the node
  - Node status: The current status of the node (e.g. Ready, NotReady)
  - Node conditions: The current conditions of the node (e.g. OutOfDisk, MemoryPressure)
  - Node addresses: The IP addresses of the node
  - Node Architecture: The architecture of the node (e.g. amd64, arm64)
  - Node System Info: Information about the node's operating system and kernel version

### Securing Node and Node Metadata

If someone modifies the node metadata, this will change the way Kubernetes schedules resources on the node. This can lead to resource starvation, performance degradation, and even downtime of the applications running on the node.
- To secure the node metadata, we can use the following methods:
  - Use RBAC to restrict access to the node metadata
  - Use Network Policies to restrict access to the node metadata
  - Using Node Isolation
  - Audits and Monitoring
  - Update and Patch Management
