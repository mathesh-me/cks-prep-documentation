## Privilege Escalation

### Sudo

- Users can use `sudo` to run commands as root user. To check if a user has sudo privileges, run the following command:

```bash
sudo -l
```
- To use sudo, User name must be in the sudoers file. To check if a user is in the sudoers file, run the following command:

```bash
sudo -l -U <username>
```

### Sudoers File

- Sudoers file is loacted at `/etc/sudoers`. It helps to control who can run what commands as root user. To view the sudoers file, run the following command:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/sudoers
```

**Example:**
```bash
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# Allow mark to run any command
mark    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# Allow Sarah to reboot the system
sarah localhost=/usr/bin/shutdown -r now
# See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives
#include /etc/sudoers.d
```
- File Syntax:
    - User or Group: The first field identifies the user or group that is assigned privileges. Groups are indicated by a % prefix.
    - Host Specification: The second field defines the host(s) where the privileges apply. Setting this to ALL generally means the rule is valid on any host, though it is often limited to localhost.
    - Run-as Specification: The third field, placed in parentheses, specifies which user(s) the command can be run as. Using ALL allows execution as any user.
    - Command Specification: The final field lists the commands the user is allowed to run. ALL gives access to any command, but you can list specific commands for finer controlâ€”like in Sarah's entry, where only certain commands are permitted.

- `sudo` also heps user to run the commands in their own shell rather than swithcing to the root shell.
